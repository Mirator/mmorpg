# Starter Zone — The Hearthring (Levels 1–5)

Design goal: teach core mechanics through world layout instead of quests.

The zone uses concentric gameplay layers around the central base. Difficulty increases with distance so players naturally learn systems step‑by‑step.

## Gameplay Teaching Order

| Ring | Player learns |
|----|----|
| A | Movement + interact |
| B | Harvest + economy |
| C | Solo combat |
| D | Danger awareness + kiting |
| E | Ability usage + grouping |

---

# Ring A — Sanctuary Plaza (0–9 radius)
**Purpose:** Safe onboarding

### Features
- Vendors clustered together
- Training dummies (1 HP, no damage)
- 3 fast‑respawn resource nodes

### Mechanics Taught
- Movement
- Interact key
- Inventory UI
- Selling items

Design principle: players learn interaction before combat.

# Ring B — Gatherer’s Garden (9–25 radius)
**Purpose:** Introduce progression loop

### Environment
Soft terrain: flowers, shrubs, logs, open visibility.

### Creatures (non‑aggressive)
| Mob | Role |
|---|---|
| Fox | atmosphere |
| Stag | living world |

### Mechanics Learned
- Harvesting radius
- Inventory filling
- Vendor economy loop
- Regeneration pacing

Primary lesson: harvest → sell → numbers increase.

---

# Ring C — Broken Fence (25–45 radius)
**Purpose:** First controlled combat

### Environment
Abandoned farms, broken carts, scattered obstacles.

### Mobs
| Mob | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Tribal | practice humanoid |
| Wolf | predictable melee |

### Mechanics Learned
- Basic attack rhythm
- Kiting basics
- First death recovery near base

Goal: teach combat without heavy punishment.

# Ring D — Thicket Edge (45–60 radius)
**Purpose:** Real danger introduction

### Environment
Denser trees and partial line‑of‑sight blocking.

### Mobs
| Mob | Lesson |
|---|---|
| Wolf packs | pulling |
| Orc | stronger single target |

### Mechanics Learned
- Pulling enemies individually
- Retreating safely
- Healing between fights

Players should now start using newly unlocked abilities.

---

# Ring E — Fallen Watchtower (60–70 radius)
**Purpose:** Final beginner challenge (Level 4–5)

### Environment
Visible landmark from spawn to create goal‑oriented exploration.

### Mobs
| Mob | Role |
|---|---|
| Orc | durable target |
| Bull (rare) | mini‑boss moment |

### Mechanics Learned
- Ability timing
- Natural player grouping
- Risk assessment and retreating

# Core Design Principle
The starter experience relies on a **danger gradient** instead of quests.

Distance from base = player confidence level.

The world itself teaches:
1. Interaction
2. Economy loop
3. Attack rhythm
4. Positioning
5. Ability timing
6. Cooperation

The zone should feel safe, then curious, then tense, then challenging — without text instructions.
